Quick and dirty Python test

  - download the `solution.py` and `test.py` files
  - implement the 4 functions in the `solution.py` file
  - all the tests should pass when you execute the `test.py`
  - using third party libraries is discouraged (you might want `certifi`)

Solutions should use Python 3. Please include a `requirements.txt` file if your solution requires third party libraries.
